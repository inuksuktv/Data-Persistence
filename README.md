# Data-Persistence

This project was completed as part of Unity's Junior Programmer pathway. It involved two tasks: pass data from one scene to another, and pass data from one game session to another. The former task was accomplished by applying DontDestroyOnLoad to a gameObject holding the data, and the latter was accomplished by serializing/deserializing the data to the user's computer in JSON format.
