# Data-Persistence

This project was completed as part of Unity's Junior Programmer pathway. It involved two tasks: pass the player's input name from one scene to another, and pass the player's name and high score from one game session to another. The former task was accomplished by applying DontDestroyOnLoad to a gameObject holding the data, and the latter was accomplished by serializing/deserializing the data to the user's computer in JSON format.
